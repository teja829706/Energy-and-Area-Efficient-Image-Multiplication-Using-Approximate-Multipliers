#  Energy and Area Efficient Image Multiplication Using Approximate Multipliers

This project presents an **8Ã—8 approximate multiplier design** optimized for low-power, area-efficient image processing. It utilizes **compressor-based logic** (4:2 and 5:2 compressors) to trade off a small amount of accuracy for significantly improved energy and silicon area efficiency, particularly suited for **embedded systems** and **real-time image processing**.

##  Abstract

In modern image processing systems, multiplication is a power-intensive operation. This project focuses on the design and implementation of **approximate multipliers** to reduce energy consumption and area usage. Through MATLAB-based simulation, we show how replacing traditional multipliers with approximate ones can:
- Lower power dissipation
- Reduce area
- Maintain acceptable image quality

Key evaluation metrics include:
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
- **Power & Delay**
- **Image fidelity**

##  Objectives

- âœ… Design approximate multipliers for image processing
- âœ… Evaluate energy, area, delay, and image quality
- âœ… Perform pixel-wise image multiplication
- âœ… Compare with conventional multipliers

##  Methodology

1. **Image Selection**  
   Two grayscale images are selected (e.g., Cameraman, Rice).

2. **Compressor Design (MATLAB)**  
   Logic-level compressor circuits (4:2, 5:2) are implemented.

3. **8Ã—8 Approximate Multiplier Design**  
   Using designed compressors.

4. **Image Multiplication (MATLAB)**  
   Perform pixel-wise image multiplication using the designed approximate multipliers.

5. **Output Analysis**  
   Evaluate using PSNR, visual inspection, and resource usage.
